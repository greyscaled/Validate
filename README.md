# Validate

An incredibly simple, zero-dependency module for writing maintainable,
easy-to-read, validation assertions.

## NPM

- `@vapurrmaid/validate` is located at
  <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vapurrmaid/validate>

### Installation

```bash
npm install --save @vapurrmaid/validate
```

## Documentation

- `Validate` API documentation generated by [`typedoc`][5] is located at
  <https://vapurrmaid.ca/Validate>

## Example Usage

Without :x:

```ts
class PositiveNumber {
  public readonly value: number;

  constructor(n: number) {
    if (n <= 0) {
      throw new Error(`n must be greater than 0`);
    }
    this.value = n;
  }
}
```

With :heavy_check_mark:

```ts
import { Validate } from "@vapurrmaid/validate";

class PositiveNumber {
  public readonly value: number;

  constructor(n: number) {
    Validate.n(n).isGreaterThan(0, `n must be greater than 0`);
    this.value = i;
  }
}
```

## Why Would I Use This

Usage of `Validate` is an opinionated, stylistic preference. Other options
exists and should be explored. The unifying goal of these libraries is to
improve logic expression and readability of source code. If the library is
complicating code, then use something else!

- The native NodeJs module [`assert`][2]
- Matchers & BDD-style assertions used in [`Jest`][3] and [`chai`][4]
